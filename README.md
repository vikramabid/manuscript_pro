# Restoration of Sanskrit
Manuscripts

## Table of Contents

- [Overview](#overview)

  
 Our project aims to develop a robust model that integrates Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and the GPT
 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) API to restore and reconstruct text from
 Sanskrit manuscripts. These ancient texts are invaluable sources of knowledge
 and culture, often degraded or damaged over time, posing challenges in interpretation and preservation. Our model will leverage cutting-edge AI technologies
 to extract, interpret, and reconstruct the content, enabling scholars and enthusiasts to access these texts more effectively.
- [Installation](#installation)

  
 Utilize existing OCR libraries or frameworks to develop an image processing
 module that converts the manuscript images into machine-readable text
 Develop the NLP module that processes the extracted text, performs languagespecific analysis such as tokenization etc.
 Utilize GPT models to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. -
 Train and fine-tune the GPT model using Sanskrit text corpus to ensure better
 reconstruction results.

- [Usage](#usage)

  
 Our data consists of thousands of Sanskrit verses, and even higher order of
 Sanskrit words. The model will be fed these verses so it can understand the
 common usages of these words, and the style theyâ€™re usually employed in, the
 various meters, and rules of prosody etc. so that our model will be able to
 effectively choose the most appropriate fillers where gaps exists so as to maintain
 the consistency of rules of poetry, prosody, and grammar of the language
